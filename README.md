## CRYPTONES V.2.0.1


**crypTones** is an application that allows users to generate frequency values from cryptocurrency price data, filter out frequency values that do not correspond to notes in a chosen key and mode, and render the audio in-browser with ToneJS. As a part of an iterative design process, I am currently (6/16/22) soliciting feedback regarding user experience in the absence of tooltips, helper text, or in-app instruction or context. I would appreciate this feedback taking the form of emails to jordan@jmwalsh.dev, rather than issues, as there is ongoing development.

This is currently **in development** and there are at least three major features that are high priority on the roadmap. 
 
## BuiltWith:
* React 18
* Typescript
* Vite
* ToneJS
* SWR
* Axios
* Material UI
* Emotion
* react-error-boundary
* Storybook


Scaffolded with Adeonir Kohl's Vite + TS + React Boilerplate, see: https://github.com/adeonir/boilerplate-react-vite

## Contribution
Currently, I am not soliciting open contributions. At this stage, I would appreciate if anyone interested in contributing to the project would reach out to me directly so I can discuss with them the project roadmap and ensure that no one is doing redundant labor. If you *must* do something *right now* I can recommend designing synthesizer instances and producing skeleton UI for controlling parameters. A style guide, design system, and storybook lib for reusable synth components are on the roadmap.
